 * This project is an application that emulates an automated ticket vending machine for movies. 
 * The vending machine accepts a subset of coins and bills and
 * allows the user to browse a list to select the movie and session, eventually returning the remaining
 * credit. The inputs are push-buttons and the output is done via UART/Terminal (which emulates a
 * screen).
 * 
 * \bug No known bugs.
